# Fake News Detection

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using machine learning techniques. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classification algorithms to classify news articles as either fake or real.

## Features

- **Dataset:** Uses a dataset of labeled news articles (fake and real) for training and testing.
- **Preprocessing:** Applies text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Classification:** Implements machine learning classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM) to classify news articles.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluates the model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries:** scikit-learn, NLTK, pandas, numpy
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
- **Dataset:** Provide details on the dataset used (source, size, attributes).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection
